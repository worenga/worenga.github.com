    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today finally the parts from China arrived which I've ordered a couple of weeks ago.
Baiscally, in order for shooting videos once in a while with my <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS_7D">Canon 7D</a>, I wanted to have some kind of external monitor,
for a more precise control over focus while shooting.
However, professional battery-operated video monitors that can can be connected through the HDMI-out, are somewhat expensive.
Furthermore, they dont give you control functionalities such adjusting focus/shutter-speed/iso/aperture on screen.</p>

<p>So, since I'm a proud owner of a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/de/consumer/mobile-device/galaxy-note/galaxy-note/GT-N7100RWDDBT">Samsung Galaxy Note 2</a> which has a nice 5,5" 1.280x720 HD Super AMOLED Screen, I was looking for Anroid Apps to remotely control a DSLR by USB.
The by far best app, I've stumbled upon was <a href="http://dslrcontroller.com/">DSRL Controller</a>, which is still in beta, but has a huge amount of functionality.</p>

<p>DSLR Controller allows you to virtually shift almost every setting to your Android device. Furthermore, there is also a Wi-Fi Passthrough that allows you to delegate all functionality to another android device connected by Wi-Fi.
There is also support for timelapses, HDR and whatnot.
Beneath DSLR Controller there are other apps available, which I find not that far evolved.

<p>For hardware I'm using a cold-shoe to ball head adapter, which can be aquired from ebay for around 7 EUR.

<p>To mount my Note 2 I've dismounted a mini tripod, which also can be found on ebay from China.

<p>For connecting your DSLR to your Samsung Note 2, one needs a USB On-The-Go Cable, which is basically a micro USB  cable which the 4th and 5th Pin shorted and connected to ground, there are a lot of videos on youtube on how to build a OTG cable. Alternatively, one can aquire a small USB-Cable for 1-3 EUR, what I did.
Furthermore, one need a USB-To Mini-USB cable to connect the OTG Cable to your camera.</p>

<p>This is what the final result looks like. I'm pretty happy, however next up is to build some kind of hood to protect the screen from ambient light.
